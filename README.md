### Hi there üëã

### My name is Lyubov Badelina

In the summer of 2023, I graduated from the Yandex course "Data Analyst". 

I see myself as a Data Analyst, because in any job I have always tried to study, research, automate and visualize any data that I had to work with in order to find opportunities for company development and workflow automation.

In one of the repositories, I present my educational analytical projects

### Data Science:
- Python (pandas, numpy, stats, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (simple, complex queries and subqueries, join, aggregating functions)
- Tableau, DataLens
- Git Bash, GitHub
- Preprocessing data before analyzing it
- Visualization of data and analysis results
- Knowledge of the basics of descriptive statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Verification and analysis of A/B testing results
- Analysis of business indicators (metrics and funnels, Cohort Analysis, Retention Rate, Conversion Rate, LTV (ARPU), CAC, ROI (ROMI), DAU, WAU, MAU)
- Excel (–í–ü–†, —Å–≤–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–∞–±–ª–∏—Ü—ã, —Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è)
- Basics of parsing
